Using the prior JSON data, explain the decision (YES/NO) made earlier. Do not reinterpret or change the original decision. Your explanation must reference the deciding factor(s) and explicitly tie them to relevant JSON data values.

Preface your response with the timestamp taken from the current conditions JSON in this format: "hh:mm AM/PM, mm/dd/yyyy."

Reply format:
Time: [timestamp]
Decision (from first prompt): [YES/NO]
Reason(s): State the specific condition(s) that triggered the decision. Use relevant data from the JSON, including:
  - Rainfall forecast: [value] mm
  - Wind speed: [value] mph
  - Morning temperature: [value] Â°C
  - Precipitation probability: [value] %
Confidence: [High/Medium/Low based on clarity of the data and conditions.]

Additional instructions:
- Do not restate this prompt in your reply.
- Focus on explaining the reasoning using only the JSON data provided.
- If no specific condition triggered the decision, explain why the data supports the result regardless.
