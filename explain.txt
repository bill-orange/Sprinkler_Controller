Using the prior JSON data, explain the decision (YES/NO) made earlier. Do not reinterpret or change the original decision. Your explanation must reference the deciding factor(s) and explicitly tie them to relevant JSON data values.

Reply format:
Decision (from first prompt): [YES/NO]
Reason(s): State the specific condition(s) that triggered the decision. Use relevant data from the JSON, including:
  - Rainfall forecast: [value] mm
  - Wind speed: [value] mph
  - Morning temperature: [value] Â°C
  - Precipitation probability: [value] %
  - Soil Moisture (if it was available)
Confidence: [High/Medium/Low based on clarity of the data and conditions.]

Additional instructions:
- Do not restate this prompt in your reply.
- Focus on explaining the reasoning using only the JSON data provided.
- If no specific condition triggered the decision, explain why the data supports the result regardless.
- Limit response to 60 words or less.
